abstract: This article synthesizes empirical research on top managers in public
  organizations. We present a systematic literature review of 138 studies
  focused on public sector top managers between 2005 and 2020. The paper
  provides descriptive results suggesting that the empirical focus on top
  managers in the public sector is increasing, though still limited compared to
  research on upper-echelons in private firms. We develop an empirically-based
  framework to guide the analysis by identifying essential elements of existing
  top management studies and linking them into relationships. Based on the
  findings of the analysis, we outline an agenda for future research on top
  management studies in the public sector that we call for more studies focusing
  on top management teams, psychological aspects of top managers, developing
  strong and unifying theories, and employing comparative research as well as
  diverse methodology.
