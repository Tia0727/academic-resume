  national main functional area.The protection and development of this area is
  of great significance to the long-term development of China.The theory of
  adaptability of public policy is applied.The results show loose birth policies
  and dual household hukou policies impede population control and migration.And
  social security policies and the rural compensation policy are also negative
  factors.With regarding to its implementation mechanism,various factors hinder
  the realization of new goals.Therefore,this paper advocates timely updating of
  population policy system and population management related policies and
